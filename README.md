# Enhancing-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Through-Deep-Learning-Architectures
Hand gesture project
Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition system to improve human-
computer interaction. Leveraged machine learning techniques to accurately
classify hand gestures and integrated the model into an interactive application
for real-time use.
1. Importing Libraries:
Utilized Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy,
and Pandas for model development, image processing, and data analysis.
2. Loading the Dataset:
Downloaded a diverse hand gesture dataset from Kaggle, ensuring
variations in lighting and background conditions for model robustness.
3. Data Preparation:
Preprocessed images by resizing them to a standard dimension of 64x64
pixels.
Applied data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, zooming) to
enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting.
Split the dataset into an 80:20 ratio for training and testing to ensure
balanced evaluation.
4. Model Creation:
Designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with:
1.Convolutional Layers for feature extraction.
2.Max-Pooling Layers to reduce feature map dimensionality.
3.Dense Layers for final classification.
Incorporated dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
5. Model Training:
Trained the CNN on the prepared dataset and evaluated its accuracy on the
test set.
6. Prediction and Real-Time Testing:
Integrated the trained model with OpenCV for real-time gesture recognition
through a live video feed.
Processed video frames with background subtraction and segmentation to
isolate hand regions.
Deployed an interactive interface using Tkinter for users to test gestures or
upload images for prediction.
